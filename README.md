# Impacts on Society

This course will be called Computer Science 8th grade, and will be taught at a Title 1 middle school in Redwood City, CA.  The course will incorporate the impacts of society by having students list and evaluate the pros and cons of computing. Topics will include but not be limited to; gender and race in computer science, digital tools for everyday tasks, social media, autonomous automobiles, computer science skills and logical thinking, and artificial intelligence. 

## Plan

### Learning Objectives

By the end of these lessons students will conduct an internet search and record search results in a document. 
By the end of these lessons students will discuss online collaboratively three benefits and three challenges of the impacts of computing on society.
At the beginning and end of these lessons students will take a self assessment of their perceptions of the impacts of computing on their lives. 

### Learning Activities

All learning activities will be accessed using class time during the regular school day. 
- The class activities will begin with a student self directed list of all the ways they can list computing impacts on their daily lives. 
- As a whole class students will share a Google Doc called T-Chart, pros and cons of computing in society.  
- As a whole class using a collaborative conversation tool called Parlay Ideas students will take one idea of their choice from the T-chart and from knowledge or research post three facts to support the topic.  Each student will be expected to read all of their classmatesâ€™ posts. 
- Students will individually conduct an internet search to estimate the income from three computer science jobs and compare those to that of entry level restaurant jobs using a Google Form linked to a class spreadsheet.
- Students will view a video that explains how the skills of programming a computer are based in literacy and logical thinking.    
- Concluding, the class activities will end with students revisiting their self directed lists of all the ways computing impacts their lives, and comparing that list to the one they completed at the beginning of the course.  


### Assessment

These learning activities will be successful if;
All students complete the pre and post inventories of how computing impacts their lives and write a conclusion. 
All students participate in the T-Chart by adding an original idea or formally acknowledging three ideas. 
All students will provide income data for three computer science jobs.  
All students participate in the Parlay Ideas online collaborative conversation and post at least one new idea, and read all of their classmates posts. 
All students can explain verbally or in writing how programming a computer develops skills that support literacy and logical thinking. 


### Outcomes

The outcome of these lessons should reinforce the idea that all students can benefit from computer science and programming skills regardless of if they go into a career in computer science. We will acknowledge that historically some demographics of student groups were not at the forefront of computer science but today, with 1:1 Chromebooks and equitable access to online learning tools those barriers have been reduced or eliminated. The idea will be provided that long-term computer science can in a positive way directly and indirectly impact their educational and learning goals. Also, the idea will be provided that long-term computing will have an impact on our society.
